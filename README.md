# K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## üìú Project Overview
This project explores the application of the **K-Means clustering** algorithm for customer segmentation. Using a dataset of mall customers, the goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their annual income and spending scores. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The notebook is divided into the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
2. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling features and handling outliers to prepare the data for clustering.
5. **Applying K-Means Clustering**: Using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the clustering model using silhouette scores.
7. **Visualization of Clusters**: Visualizing the customer clusters using scatter plots.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and providing insights for business decision-making.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used is `"Mall_customers.csv"`, which includes the following features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
The following libraries and tools were used in this project:
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing K-Means clustering and evaluating the model.
